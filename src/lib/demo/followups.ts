At loaded cost, that's another $18k/year.\n\nHappy to walk through this with your CFO whenever works.\n\nBest,\nMarcus",

We read the transcript via API (no extra work for you)\n3. We update Salesforce, draft follow-ups, and brief your next meeting\n\nThink of it as the action layer that sits on top of Gong's capture layer. We don't replace — we complete the loop.\n\nI've attached a one-pager with the architecture diagram. Want to see it live?\n\nBest,\nAisha",
